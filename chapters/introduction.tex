\section{Introduction}
The "Escaper Bot" is a moving platform,with a mounted front distance sensor.Its fuctionality consists in keep a constant distance between itself and an object detected in a set radius around it.Since it has been supplied with only one sensor,during its "standy" (no object detected in front of it) should start rotating around its rotation axis, until an object is detected and robot reacts to keep the same desired distance from this object.
